This fork of ruby-cg (originally by William Pratt, later by Ricardo Ruiz) is modified to support
ruby 1.9 unicode, fix a few bugs etc.

Tests are not updated yet, only fixes here.

Also included: 'cgtools' script, filling some gaps in CGate web administration, namely 
- getting info about user: lists user is member of, friends and roster membership
- deleting user: cleaning other users rosters too
- viewing and cleaning temporary blacklisted IPs
